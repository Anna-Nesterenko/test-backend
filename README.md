**Project Overview** <br/>
<br/>
This project is a Node.js server application that uses Socket.IO <br/>
for real-time communication and MariaDB with Knex.js for database management. <br/>
The server provides endpoints for user and topic management, allowing administrators to create, <br/>
update, and delete users and topics. Users can view topics and receive real-time notifications about new topic creations.<br/>
<br/>
